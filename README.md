# 🤖 Machine Learning Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning practice repository**!  
This repo is dedicated to hands-on experimentation and learning, and it will serve as part of my **professional portfolio** as I grow my skills in data science and machine learning.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Document my journey as I learn and apply ML concepts.
- Showcase my understanding through practical examples and cleaned-up code notebooks.
- Build a portfolio of work that demonstrates proficiency in data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning.

## 🗂️ Current Projects

### `data_cleaning_athlete_medals.ipynb`
- Focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset of Olympic athlete medals.
- Techniques used include handling missing values, type conversions, and data transformation.

### `data_cleaning_athlete_events.ipynb`
An extension of the data cleaning process applied to athlete event data:
- Addressing inconsistencies in event naming
- Normalizing categorical variables
- Preparing the dataset for exploratory analysis and modeling
